**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Pygame

**Pygame** is a free and open-source library for Python programming language used for creating games and multimedia applications. It offers a set of modules for creating graphics, animations, sounds, and other interactive features. Pygame is easy to learn and has a large online community for support and development.

**Objective**: To create a user-friendly and interactive drum simulator using the Pygame library for Python programming language.

**Scope**: The project will involve using Pygame's sound and event handling capabilities to create a drum simulator with multiple drum pads and different sound samples. The user will be able to play the drum pads by clicking or pressing keys on their keyboard. The program will have a graphical user interface displaying the drum pads and allowing the user to control the volume and select different drum kits.

Features:

- Multiple drum pads with different sound samples
- Ability to play the drum pads using keyboard or mouse clicks
- Volume control
- Selection of different drum kits
- Graphical user interface displaying the drum pads
- Tools and Technologies: Python programming language, Pygame library.

Methodology: The project is developed using the following steps:

[-] Research and gather information on the Pygame library and its capabilities for creating games and multimedia applications.

[-] Design the graphical user interface, including the drum pads and other controls.

[-] Load the sound samples into Pygame.

[-] Implement the event handling capabilities to listen for key presses or mouse clicks and play the corresponding drum sound.

[] Add the volume control and drum kit selection features.

[-] Test and debug the program to ensure it is working correctly.

[-] Finalize the project and prepare the documentation.
